# The EDU Wheelchair

by Dario, Samira and Chung

# project description:
The EDU wheelchair is a connected wheelchair specifically designed for museum context in order to enhance the experience of visiting a museum exhibition for everyone, both disabled people and not.
As guides do, the connected wheelchair will lead the visitors through the works of art by following different paths, according to visitors’ moods and the museum visitors’ preferences database.
Each wheelchair is equipped with heart rate sensor to detect the mood state of the visitor throughout the visiting experience and pressure sensors on the back of the chair to register when the visitor is bored or interested to the exhibition contents.
The data collected by the devices, will be used either by the museum to improve the overall visiting experience and by the internal processor to learn about user preferences and adjust the visiting flow.

# List of sensors:
-	GPS sensor (beacon for indoor use) tracks the position of the user in the space
-	Gyroscope knows the orientation of the wheelchair
-	Neopixel leds can replace a display interface and simulate a smart compass based on the info from GPS sensor and Gyroscope
-	(2) pressure sensor, placed on the back of the chair can recognize relaxed or interested posture
-	Heart rate sensor can detect the “emotional” reaction of a person to a work of art.

# We are not sure if the sensors we identified are the ones needed for the implementation of our idea so we would like to discuss that with you before buying unnecessary components.


Wheelchair Design Platform is a repository that contains some resources to help
designers and developers speak the same language, and work together towards
addressing relevant challenges for wheelchair users. It is a collection of
workshop materials, code examples and also a compilation of resources to foster
a prospering research and design community around wheelchair users.

## Workshops

* [Getting started](/docs/workshops/GettingStarted.md)
* [Workshop 1: Building an Internet-Connected Wheelchair](/docs/workshops/Workshop1.md)
* [Workshop 2: Integrating and Visualising Sensor-Based Data](/docs/workshops/Workshop2.md)
* [Workshop 3: Developing Algorithms and Controlling Actuators](/docs/workshops/Workshop3.md)
* [Workshop 4: Developing and Conducting a Data Collection Campaign](/docs/workshops/Workshop4.md)
* [Workshop 5: Implementing a Machine Learning Pipeline](/docs/workshops/Workshop5.md)
* [Workshop 6: Developing a Product Analytics Dashboard](/docs/workshops/Workshop6.md)

## Resources

* This platform uses two programming languages, Python on computers and C on
micro-controllers. While descriptions and examples of code should help you
get started, you can find some additional resources
[here](/docs/resources/software.md "Python and C resources").

* Documentation of your project is key,
[here are some tips and examples](/docs/resources/documentation.md "Documentation tips and examples").

* [Git manipulation such as Pull Request](/docs/resources/git.md "Git manipulation").

## Main Components

__**Disclaimer:**__ the design of this platform focuses on flexibility and
technology exploration rather than optimisation.

The main design includes a Raspberry Pi 3 and an Arduino Mega 2560 on the wheelchair frame.

The Arduino Mega is the micro-controller of the platform. Fixed on the main frame of the wheelchair,
it can collect data from sensors (e.g. force sensors, accelerometers), and trigger actions from actuators
(e.g. LEDs, vibration motors).

More on the Arduino Mega can be found [here](/docs/resources/arduino.md "Arduino resources").

Raspberry Pi is a small computer. It is also fixed to the main frame of the wheelchair,
where it can:
* interact with the Arduino Mega via USB to receive data and transmit commands;
* interact with the Internet to transmit commands and receive data;
* store data locally in files;
* run (machine learning) algorithms.

More on the Raspberry Pi can be found [here](/docs/resources/raspberrypi.md "Raspberry Pi resources").

These components fit together as shown on the following diagram. A large powerbank
powers the Raspberry Pi. The Arduino Mega communicates and receives power from the
Raspberry Pi via USB. A Feather (Arduino-like development board) on the wheel connects to
the Raspberry Pi via Bluetooth to sense and actuate from the wheel.
